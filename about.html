<h1>Introducing to TMC Student Club...</h1>
<p>“Work hard, play hard!” Experience an enriching, vibrant and active campus-life through the activities organised by the student club.</p>
<p>
The TMC Student Club was set up in 2006 to develop the students holistically and enrich students’ learning experiences. It provides students with the opportunity to participate and organise exciting and meaningful activities for the TMC student body and have a more balanced, enhanced and vibrant campus life. The Student Club Student Executive Committee (Student EXCO) works closely with the Student Club Staff Executive Committee (Staff EXCO), the Student Club members and the TMC student body to provide:
</p>
<ul>
<li>a vibrant community for the student body</li>
<li>an interesting schedule of student-led events and activities opportunities for students to explore various interests</li>
<li>opportunities for students to gain hands-on experience to plan and organise activities, manage people and resources and cultivate leadership qualities as well as develop leadership potential</li>
inculcate TMC’s values to the student body.
</ul>
